# intra-organisational-server

This is a personal project aimed to provide affordable, private and secure communicational channels to small organizations or groups. 
The communication channels are controlled by the organization itself, without the involvement of a third party (usually the ISP) and thus the conversation is limited to the employees of the organization.

The project utilises the concept of socket programming implemented using Dart and has been published as a mobile app using Flutter.

This image shows us the networking channel which employs the use of a home router to provide the medium of communication.

This picture shows the entire process as it unfolds in the server log. First the connections are made and messages are sent and received after which a decentralized P2P connection is created, whose communication is not visible to the server.
